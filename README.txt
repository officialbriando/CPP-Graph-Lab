CPSC 350 Graph Lab

Notes:
- The graph will be based off the adjacency matrix class.
- Assumes that the graph is composed only of nodes which do not contain any data other then their label.
- Labels are set as ints.
- The graph is directed & unweighted.
    - Because there are no weights, Primm's and Dijkstra's algorithm will only return subtrees based on the first encountered edge.
